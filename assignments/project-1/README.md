## Instructions
- `assignment-1.ipynb` is the interactive notebook which contains the Python code for the Na√Øve Bayes classifier. __This will need to be run on Python 3.8 or higher.__ This is because I have made use of the `:=` 'walrus' assignment operator. Since no Python version was specified I assume this is ok, but if not any `:=` assignments will have to be split up over two lines to be compatible with Python 3.7 or below.
- `distribution-vis.R` is a small piece of R code I used to generate some data visualisations for my report. I am unsure of whether this will be assessed but I've included it anyway.
- `report/` contains all the LaTeX and supplementary files for the report. I believe this can be ignored unless someone wanted to investigate it in more detail.

All results should print out when running `assignment-1.ipynb`, so there is no additional results file. The results are also summarised in `report/project-1.pdf` which is the file I have submitted for my report.
